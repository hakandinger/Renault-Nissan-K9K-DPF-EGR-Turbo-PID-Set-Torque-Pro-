# Renault-Nissan-K9K-DPF-EGR-Turbo-PID-Set-Torque-Pro-
This repository contains a custom PID CSV set for Renault / Nissan K9K (1.5 dCi) engines, designed for use with Torque Pro and ELM327 / Vgate OBD adapters.  The goal of this project is to provide a single, complete, and practical PID set to monitor DPF regeneration, EGR behavior, turbo health, and oil dilution in real driving conditions.
