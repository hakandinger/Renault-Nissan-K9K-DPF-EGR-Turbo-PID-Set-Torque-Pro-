# Renault-Nissan-K9K-DPF-EGR-Turbo-PID-Set-Torque-Pro-
This repository contains a custom PID CSV set for Renault / Nissan K9K (1.5 dCi) engines, designed for use with Torque Pro and ELM327 / Vgate OBD adapters.  The goal of this project is to provide a single, complete, and practical PID set to monitor DPF regeneration, EGR behavior, turbo health, and oil dilution in real driving conditions.


🚗 Supported Vehicles

Renault & Nissan vehicles equipped with K9K 1.5 dCi

ISO 15765-4 (CAN 11bit / 500 kbps)

Tested primarily with:

Torque Pro (Android)

Vgate / ELM327-compatible adapters

⚠️ PID availability depends on ECU software version.
Some PIDs may not respond on all vehicles.
